      "description": "I've worked and collaborated for years with Daniel - and I hope that we will keep it at it for years to come. Daniel is a very mindful individual that knows how to stay grounded within the reality and scope of your projects, and will do everything he can to bring life and soul to some of the most complex and often overlooked sides of music production. KodamaSounds' identity and strength could come along only thanks to his numerous song contributions, mixes, and technical expertise. If you're looking for quality and someone to listen, you need a Daniel.",
